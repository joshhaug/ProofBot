## About ProofBot
ProofBot is an open-source, cross-platform proofwriting application which subscribes to the heuristics outlined in Gries and Schneider’s *A Logical Approach to Discrete Math* (LADM), Springer-Verlag, 1993.  It was designed in particular as a tool for students of Pepperdine University’s *Formal Methods* and *Discrete Structures* courses.  

A list of theorems from LADM as compiled by Prof. J. Stanley Warford can be found [here](http://www.cslab.pepperdine.edu/warford/math221/221-Equations.pdf).

To avoid the headache of writing platform-specific software, ProofBot was written using the Qt framework.

## Features
* Cross-platform printer support
* Saves each proof as a convenient little .txt file
* Quick and painless typesetting (and all typeset elements are just Unicode!)
* Elegant and non-intrusive syntax hilighting

## Planned Features
* Expand list of recognized symbols
* Selective markdown support
* Included list of theorems (hopefully with auto-completion)
